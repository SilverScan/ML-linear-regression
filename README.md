# Linear Regression Machine Learning Model
## My process
For this, I aimed to recreate a model which I learned how to create using a tutorial not too long ago. In this, it's fed 100 points which are linear on a graph using the mx + b formula. I used an 80/20 split, giving it 80% to train on and 20 to test. The code is written in Python in a Jupyter notebook. I used PyTorch's framework to train along with matplotlib to plot the points. Although I have already created this, as stated before, I figured it would be a good exercise to work on. I also need to figure out how to work github so I decided to use this as a way to learn ðŸ˜… I didn't bother to add saving or loading to this model because I figured that is basic enough, I wanted to focus more on the learning part
